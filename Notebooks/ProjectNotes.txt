--New ideas--
Random Forest Classifier
LSTM
New feature extractors
    sin,cos for first layers (pre-processing on input)
Train/Test on each sample, then do some kind of voting
Some kind of ResNet arch. 
    Deep networks, non-RNN based
Filter data (pre-processing)
Counteract high-probability misclassifications 
Hierarchical detection arch.
    Yes/no -> how many channels
Bidirectional RNN
